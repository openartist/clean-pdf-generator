# clean-pdf-generator
Generate "clean" pdfs from Wordpress pages.

Activate the plugin and add the "Download PDF" block into your page. When clicked it will initate Dompdf to export a pdf of your page.

Current issues:
• The output does not include all styles and fonts.
• Should allow user to enter an html link with ID instead of block button
• Need to add method for user to specify file download name (as a parameter in the button)
